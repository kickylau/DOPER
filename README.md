## Welcome to the DOPER wiki!

Doper, the clone of Rover, allows you to book either a dog walk or a drop-in visit service provided by 10 verified walkers for all your pets! 

## Application Architecture

Doper is built a React frontend with a Flask backend, using PostgreSQL as a database. 

## Technologies used 

### Frontend 

* React
* Redux
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

### Backend

* Flask
* Python
* PostgreSQL
* SQLAlchemy

## DOPER setup
1. Clone this repository (only this branch)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kickylau/DOPER/
   ```

2. Install dependencies

      ```bash
      pipenv install --dev -r dev-requirements.txt && pipenv install -r requirements.txt
      ```

3. Create a **.env** file based on the example with proper settings for your development environment

4. Setup your PostgreSQL user, password and database and make sure it matches your **.env** file

5. Get into your pipenv, migrate your database, seed your database, and run your flask app

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

   ```bash
   flask seed all
   ```

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

6. To run the React App in development, checkout the [README](./react-app/README.md) inside the `react-app` directory.

***


*IMPORTANT!*
   psycopg2-binary MUST remain a dev dependency because you can't install it on apline-linux.
   There is a layer in the Dockerfile that will install psycopg2 (not binary) for us.
***

### Dev Containers (Option for M1 Users)

1. Make sure you have the [Microsoft Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension installed.
2. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed on your computer.
3. Clone the repository (only this branch)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YinYang117/Travel-Bucket.git
   ```
4. Open the repo in VS Code.
5. Click "Open in Container" when VS Code prompts to open container in the bottom right hand corner.
6. **Be Patient!** The initial install will take a LONG time, it's building a container that has postgres preconfigured and even installing all your project dependencies. (For both flask and react!)

   **Note:** This will take much less time on future starts because everything will be cached.

7. Once everything is up, be sure to make a `.env` file based on `.env.example` in both the root directory and the *react-app* directory before running your app.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

8. Get into your pipenv, migrate your database, seed your database, and run your flask app

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

   ```bash
   flask seed all
   ```

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

9. To run the React App in development, checkout the [README](./react-app/README.md) inside the `react-app` directory.
